## Reporting a Vulnerability

>>How to report a vulnerability.

Feel free to report your doubts and possible threats/vulnerabilities by creating a 
new branch to `main` of this repository.

Or you could mail me personally at <rahulvb.com+SCARSsecurity@gmail.com>

>>What to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or declined, etc.

Your valuable notifications shall be definitely taken into account and shall be guaranteed 
to give you a response over it. But do know that not all of them shall be entertained. Only 
after heavy go-through we shall reflect over it.
